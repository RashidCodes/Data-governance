<h1> The Project Design</h1>

For over a decade, arrow energy have efficiently explored and developed gas fields, produced and sold coal seam gas, and generated electricity (arrow energy, 2021). To effectively carry out their mandate, the company uses several IoT (Internet to Things) devices in addition to the expert knowledge. In the Oil and Gas industry, IoT refers to a well-defined interconnection of physical objects (devices) connected to the internet. The devices possess the capability of data transmission of a network without any human involvement (Internet of things applications to fight against COVID-19, 2021). For example, the level of gas in gas tanks are monitored using sensors that provide real-time data for cloud-based digital dashboards. This alerts maintenance teams of potential issues associated with the tank. These devices generate a tremendous amount of data and the lack of data management inhibit the ability of the company to make data-driven decisions. 


<h2>Problem</h2>
Arrow energy seeks to become a data driven business however, it lacks one constant, reliable source for verified real-time information. This can be attributed to data being spread over a silo management practice (Resolving data duplication, 2021*). 

<h2>Outcome Definition</h2>

The aim of this project is develop a proof of concept master data management system that consolidates common critical data that gives value across the business into central system datasets. These datasets will be considered as a "golden record" - the one version of current and true data.

<h3>Importance of the Project</h3>

Ultimately, Arrow energy seeks to use data to derive insights about the their operations. In addition, the company seeks to use its growing repository of data to gain a competitive edge (Big data analytics capabilities: a systematic literature review, 2017), essentially adding business value to the company.

The implementation of the proof of concept data management system will aids arrow in identifying and solving internal problems, thus improving customer experience and streamlining work activities. Additionally, the system will provide managers with a broad-picture of the business, which aids in planning. Lastly, data that is properly managed (high quality) can be mined used for business intelligence purposes. This is beneficial in a number of ways including:

- Improved security of critical information.
- Timely machine learning
- Reduced operational expenses in hardware.

<h2>Methodology Design</h2>

There are three sets of elements of Master data management that are instrumental to improve data quality for business intelligence purposes (Resolving data duplication, 2021). The first set comprises Entity Resolution (ER) and Entity Identity Information Management (EIIM). Entity resolution, also known as de-duplication or record linking refers to the elimination of duplicate records to ameliorate data quality in database systems. 

<h2>Team Formation</h2>

The development of a proof of concept MDMS requires team members have both technical and research skills. Technical skills include reasonable working knowledge of databases and software development whereas research skills mainly comprise the ability to peruse research papers and judge the relevance of each paper. Each team member is selected for their unique set of abilities. See table 1 below for team members and their respective roles.
