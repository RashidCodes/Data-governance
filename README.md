<h1> The Project Management Lecture (Week 2)</h1>

<h2>Why ICT Project Management</h2>

- Complexity of ICT Business Environment
- To be successful, ICT corporations need to be conversant with and use modern project management techniques.
- Intagible products: IT project managers cannot see progress.
- No standard process
- No clear relationships between software process and product types.
- Rapid changes in technology outdate previous experiences.


<h2>What is a Project?</h2>

- **Research-based**: This involves a thorough investigation in a particular area.
- **Development** of software and hardware systems, process models, methods, and other interim documents.
- **Evaluation**
- **Industry-based**: This involves solving a problem within either organisation or another university department.
- **Problem Solving**: Development of a new technique to solve some problem.

<blockquote>Our project is an **Industry** project since we're trying to improve the data architecture of the company</blockquote>

<h2>TRIPLE CONSTRAINT</h2>

- Time
- Scope
- Cost


<h2> Success Factors</h2>

Focus on the highlighted points.

- **User involvement**
- **Executive management support**
- **Clear statement of requirements**
- **Proper planning**
- **Realistic Expectations**
- Smaller Project Milestones
- Competent Staff
- Ownership
- Clear vision and objectives
- Hard-working, Focused Staff
- Other


<h2> Approaches to Develop WBS</h2>

- Using a guideline based on previous projects
- Top down approach: High level tasks are decomposed into multiple subtasks.
- Bottom-up approach
- Mind-mapping approach

<blockquote>Which approach should we use in our team?</blockquote>

We could take a **combinatorial** approach: We can use a top-down approach and using mind-mapping to figure out the sub-tasks of each task.


<h2>Scheduling</h2>
Read about CPM (Critical Path Method), or Arrow on Diagram.

<h2>Typical problems with IT Cost Estimates</h2>

- Estimates are done too quickly
- Lack of estimating experience
- Management desires accuracy
- Human beings are biased towards underestimation.


<h2>Cost estimation techniques</h2>

- Top-down estimates: Based on previous similar projects. It also requires expert knowledge, and its generally less accurate.
- Bottom-up estimates: Estimate individual tasks and sum them up to get the total; the accuracy depends on the size.
- Parametric modelling: Use parameters in a mathematical model to estimate. It's reliable when the historical information is accurate.


<h2> Cost control </h2>

- Planned value (PV)
- Actual cost (AC)
- Rate of performance (RP)


<h2>Customer Driven Quality</h2>
What does our customer want? 
Proof of concept at the moment.

  <h3>Meta-data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The client wants us to understand the importance of meta-data and suggest methods to the quality of it.</li>
    <li>We have a general understanding of what meta-data is however, we need to improve our theory. Subsequently, we can suggest some tools.</li>
    <li>He also mentioned <b>Technical</b> and <b>Business</b> meta-data. We have to do some research about that as well.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember, the customer is willing to pay money for what he wants.</p>

  <h3>Master Data</h3>
  <p> According to Wikipedia, Master data represents "data about the business entities that provide context for business transactions". Master data is, by its nature, almost always non-transactional in nature. However, there exists edge cases where an organization may need to treate certain transactional processes and operations as "master data". This arises for example, where information about master data entities, such as customers or products, is only contained within transactional data such as orders and receipts and is not house separately. <i style="font-weight:bold;">(Wikipedia, 2021)</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We have to suggest ways to improve existing architectures. Obviously, we'd need to do some research.
  </ul>
  <p>Remember, the customer is willing to pay money for what he wants.

  <h3>Data Quality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is data quality?</li>
    <li>Again, we need to do some research about quality. Every endeavor should contribute to the effective usage for the data for business intelligence purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember, the customer is willing to pay money for what he wants.

<h2> Quality Evaluation Factors </h2>
<h3>Quality of the process</h3>

- Results
- Experience
- Project team

<h2>Quality Management</h2>

 - Initiating
 - Planning
 - Executing and Controlling
 - Closing

<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
Quality assurance refers to the maintainance of a desired level of quality in a service or product especially by means of attention to every stage of the process or delivery or production.

- Benefit-Cost analysis
- Benchmarking
- Flowcharting
- Design of experiments
- Cost of quality analysis
- Quality audits (scheduled or random)


<h2>Quality Control Approaches</h2>

- **Peer Review**: The process of allowing team members to review each other's work.
- **Statistical sampling**: the process of choosing a percentage of results at random.
- **Management by walking around**: Get out of your office and get into the working environment.
- **Reviews by Outside Experts**: Hire an outside expert to review the project as it progresses.

For our project, we can try point 1 and 4.


<h2>Quality Control Decisions</h2>

- Acceptance decisions
- Rework
- Process adjustments


<h2>Key Stakeholder in Communication</h2>

You have to identify who you're going to be communicating with.

- Project Sponsor/Owner
- Project Steering Committee
- Project Manager
- Technical Manager/Business Manager/Team Leader
- Project Team
- Project support groups
- Other Project stakeholder



<h2>Communication Plan</h2>
Before we go for a meeting with Charles, we have to do a little planning. First of, we have to schedule it. Secondly, we have to provide some information about what will be discussed at the meeting. We also have to talk about who will receive the information as well as who produce it.


Moreover, we have to think of technologies for conveying information. For example, our team uses MS Teams for video calls and Slack for texts.

The frequency of our communication is also another topic to think about. Currently, I've creating a recurring meeting time on our calendars. So we're definitely meeting at least once every week.

<blockquote>Get a template to document meeting minutes.</blockquote>

Additionally, we have to discuss how issues will be resolved.

Penultimately, we have to discuss the revision procedures for updating the communications management plan.


<h2>Information Distribution</h2>
Revisit the medium choice matrix to see various information distribution media and their priority in varying circumstances.


<h2>Why Projects fail</h2>
Project most commonly fail because there is a lack fo attention and efforts being applied to seven project performance factors:

- Focus on business value, not technical detail.
- Who is responsible for what? (Establish clear accoutability for measure results).
- Have consistent processes for managing unambiguous checkpoints.
- Have a consistent methodology for planning and executing projects.
- Include the customer at the beginning of the project and continually involve the customer as things change so that the required adjustments can be made together.
- Manage and motivate people so that project efforts will experience a zone of optimal performance throughout its life.
- Provide the project team members the tools and techniques they need to produce consistently successful projects.

<h2>Risk Management Planning</h2>
Read about risk management in the PMBOK guide.

<h3> Risk Identification </h3>

- Review project documents
- Brainstorming
- Delphi technique
- Assumptions analysis
- Root cause analysis
- SWOT analysis
