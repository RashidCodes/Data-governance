# Data-governance Project: Capstone Project

## Revisiting Project management process groups
It is important to understand how the knowledge areas fit into a big picture of managing a project.

## Process
A process is a series of actions directed towards a particular result. Project management process groups progress from
- Initiating activities
- Planning activities
- Executing activities
- Monitoring and Controlling activities
- Closing activities

***Recall that a project can have different combinations of phases however, all project phases need to include all 5 process groups.***

## 5 process groups
### Initiation
This includes defining and authorizing a project or project phase. Initiating processes take place during each phase of a project.

<br/>

### Planning
This includes devising and maintaining a workable scheme to ensure that the project addresses the organization's needs. Projects include several plans including scope management plan, schedule management plan, cost management plan, and procurement management plan. These plans define each knowledge area as it relates to the project at a particular point in time. For example, a project team must define the work needed for the project, to schedule activities related to that work, to estimate costs for performing the work, and to decide what resources to procure to accomplish the work.

<br/>

### Execution
This includes coordinating people and other resources to carry out the various plans and create the products, and service, or resutls of the project or phase. Examples of executing processes include 
- acquiring and developing the project team
- performing quality assurance
- distributing information
- managing stakeholder expectations
- conducting procurements

<br/>

### Monitoring and Controlling
This includes regularly measuring and monitoring progress to ensure that the project team meets the project objectives. The project manager and staff monitor and measure progress against the plans and take corrective action when necessary. A common monitoring and controlling process is **reporting performance**, where project stakeholders can identify any necessary changes that may be required to keep the project on track.

<br/>

### Closing
This includes formalizing the acceptance of the project and ending it efficiently. Activities performed include:
- Archiving project files
- Closing out contracts
- Documenting lessons learned
- Receiving formal acceptance of the delivered work

***Remember that process groups are not mutually exclusive. For example, project managers must perform monitoring and controlling processes throughout the project's life span***
